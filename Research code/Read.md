Script Overview
Introduction
This Python script facilitates the sending of marketing emails to a list of recipients extracted from a CSV file. It leverages the smtplib library for email sending and pandas for reading the CSV file.

Software Design Principles
1. Separation of Concerns
The script is organized into distinct functions, each handling a specific task:

send_email: Responsible for composing and sending the email.
load_email_addresses: Responsible for loading email addresses from a CSV file.
main: The entry point that orchestrates the workflow.
This separation enhances maintainability and makes it easier to test individual components.

2. Single Responsibility Principle
Each function has a single responsibility:

send_email manages email creation and sending.
load_email_addresses deals exclusively with reading email data.
By adhering to this principle, the code becomes more modular and easier to understand.

3. Error Handling
The script incorporates basic error handling using a try-except block in the send_email function. This ensures that failures in sending an email do not terminate the entire program and provides feedback on which emails failed.

4. Configuration Management
Sensitive information like the sender's email and password should ideally be managed securely, such as through environment variables or a configuration file, instead of hardcoding them. This helps maintain security and allows for easier updates.

5. Scalability
The current structure allows for easy expansion. For instance, you can add features like:

HTML email formatting.
Email scheduling.
Logging for successful and failed sends.
Conclusion
This script serves as a foundational tool for email marketing campaigns. By adhering to software design principles, it ensures clarity, maintainability, and scalability, making it a solid starting point for further develo
